This is cocktails project. In this project, you can see and search for cocktails. Then you can choose your cocktail and learn more about it. The app fetch all cocktails from https://thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=a API. I used google_fonts(for adding special font to project), easy_search_bar(for searching data on the app bar easily) and http(for sending http request via Flutter).
